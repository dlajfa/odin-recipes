        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A jarred red curry paste is the central flavor of this wonderfully restorative and nourishing broth. Coconut milk lends a subtle creaminess, and the cherry tomatoes become bright little jammy bursts. You can use fresh tomatoes when in season, but canned tomatoes do just as well. Ladle the piping hot broth over seasoned tofu pieces and fresh herbs: The delicate silken tofu used here will absorb big flavors from the surrounding liquid.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 (14-ounce) packages silken tofu, drained</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed</li>
            <li>2 shallots, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>1 (1-inch) piece ginger, scrubbed and grated</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons red curry paste/li>
            <li>1 (14-ounce) can cherry tomatoes or fresh cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable stock</li>
            <li>1 (13.5-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1.5 cups mixed fresh herbs, such as cilantro, basil and dill</li>
            <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 lime, cut into wedges, for squeezing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Pat the tofu blocks dry with a clean kitchen or paper towel. Cut each block into 3 slices.</li>

            <li>Heat a medium Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high. Add the oil and shallots, and stir until softened, 2 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger and curry paste, stir, and cook until fragrant and the paste turns deep red, 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, stir and bring to a simmer. Simmer until the tomato juices thicken slightly, 4 minutes.</li>

            <li>Pour in the vegetable stock, stir, increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer to slightly reduce the liquid, 10 minutes. Stir in the coconut milk, season to taste with salt and remove from the heat.</li>

            <li>While the broth is simmering, divide the soft tofu into 6 bowls. Break each slice into 4 or 5 pieces. Season each bowl of tofu with 2 teaspoons of soy sauce and a few cracks of black pepper, and top with about Â¼ cup of the fresh herb mix.</li>
            
            <li>Ladle the hot broth and tomatoes over the bowls of silken tofu. Top with sliced scallions and serve hot, with lime wedges for squeezing.</li>
        </ol>
